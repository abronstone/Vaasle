# Overview

## Guidelines

[Guidelines](https://github.com/mlepinski/Adv-software-design/blob/main/Final%20Project/first%20deliverable.md)

## Team Contract

- What tools will you use for communication?

- Discord server and group iMessage thread

- How often do you expect each person to check project-related messages? If you ask a question, when should you expect a response? Are there hours of the day when messages should not be sent?

- 1-2x a day, or within a reasonable time if you get a notification (24 hours)

- No hours of the day when messages can't be sent, but we don't expect a reply during the night or at other unreasonable times (weekend evening, etc...)

- How do you keep track of who is working on what task? Trello? Some other Kanban board? Assigning GitHub Issues? Something else? (Note: Two is often a good number of people to assign to a task.)

- Assigning GitHub issues, which will be associated with a GitHub project

- Merged pull requests will close these issues

- [abronstone/vaas-final: Carleton College CS348: Final Project. Team Vaas (github.com)](https://github.com/abronstone/vaas-final)

- It is vital that every decision the group makes is recorded. (If something isn't recorded, it hasn't been decided.) How/where does your group record decisions?

- We don't need an extremely formal structure for documenting decisions (i.e. API proposals, RFCs, etc.) since we are using Discord as our primary means of communication.

- We can always refer back to Discord to refer to our past decisions.

- We should provide quality documentation on task tickets

- I highly recommend that you use short Standup meetings multiple times a week to check in on progress. When will these standup meetings take place. (Remember: Don't solve problems at Stand-up meetings, just check in and if there is an issue assign a couple people to discuss it in between meetings.)

- Scheduled for every T/Th from 1:30 --Â 2 p.m.

- When will you block out time for longer meetings when you have larger issues to discuss among all team members? (Note: My advice is to use these meetings primarily for big-picture design questions.)

- These will occur on a case-by-case basis when we need to discuss big features and make large decisions.
