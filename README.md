**Team Vaas**: Aaron Bronstone, Aidan Roessler, Varun Saini, Serafin Patino

## Running the Application
1. Before running the application locally, ask for a `secrets.env` file from application owners, and insert it into `src/mongo`. This contains the database credentials
2. To start the containers and run the CLI, run the following command from the root directory of the project (Unix):
   ```
   ./start.sh
   ``````
    or on Windows:

    ```
    ./start.bat
    ```
3. If you are running this script for the first time on Mac, you may need to give it permission to execute. To do this, run the following command:
    ```
    chmod u+x start.sh
    ````
4. Go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser to view the Front End
