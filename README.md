## Running Locally
1. Before running the application locally, ask for a `secrets.env` and a `.env.local` file from application owners, and add them to the `src/mongo` and `src/frontend` directories respectively. These contain the database and Auth0 credentials.
2. To start the containers, make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (or equivalent) installed, and run the following command from the root directory of the project:
```
docker compose up --build
```
3. Go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser to play Wordle!

## Navigating/Playing Vaasle
1. You will be prompted to log in, and you can either play a singleplayer or multiplayer game.
2. For multiplayer games, ensure that each player is logged in to a different account.
3. To test multiplayer locally, you can use two different browsers or windows (for example, one in Incognito/Private mode).
