## Running Locally
1. Before running the application locally, ask for a `secrets.env` and a `.env.local` file from application owners, and add them to the `src/mongo` and `src/frontend` directories respectively. These contain the database and Auth0 credentials.
2. To start the containers and run the CLI, run the following command from the root directory of the project:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
3. Go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser to play Wordle!
